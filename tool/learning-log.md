    * Learned how to navigate throuigh the camera view
    * Also learned how to manipulate shape (I.e Scaling,Moving,Rotating,etc)

### 11/4/2023:

Mega hiatus due to workload but I am back
* Started tinkering with Godot
    * Similar to Unity, I tried to navigate through the menu, checking guides , and modifying shapes.
    * Godot on documentation seems a bit lackluster compared to Unity. Unity gives you full indepth documentation for beginners while Godot feels lacking. It is trying to tell me what this is suppose to do but I'm often confused what am I'm supposed to do. Maybe I am doing it wrong?
