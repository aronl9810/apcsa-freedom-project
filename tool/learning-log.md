---

### 9/28/2023:
* Made a Trello Board for me and Xin Yan to keep track on our progress

### 10/29/2023:
* Started tinkering with Unity
* Learned how to [navigate through](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/explore-the-unity-editor-1#) the Unity Editor
    * Learned how to navigate throuigh the camera view
    * Also learned how to manipulate shape (I.e Scaling,Moving,Rotating,etc)

### 11/4/2023:

Mega hiatus due to workload but I am back
* Started tinkering with Godot
    * Similar to Unity, I tried to navigate through the menu, checking guides , and modifying shapes.
    * Godot on documentation seems a bit lackluster compared to Unity. Unity gives you full indepth documentation for beginners while Godot feels lacking. It is trying to tell me what this is suppose to do but I'm often confused what am I'm supposed to do. Maybe I am doing it wrong?

### 11/13/2023:

* Calendar sync with Trello established
* Linked tutorials on C# tutorials and linked basic Unity tutorial projects
* Learned C# with this [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFayQioG71A)
    * Learned its almost but nearly idential to java.

### 11/26/2023:
* Complted the C# tutorial
* Started a sample project for the FPS game before moving on to the main game. Will be using this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJqP5EesxLk&list=PLGUw8UNswJEOv8c5ZcoHarbON6mIEUFBC&index=1)
* Created the cards to start the sample project before moving on to the main project
* Began the sample project by following the tutorial on the link at **11/26/2023**
    * Created a player capsule and setting the camera position to 0 , 0.6 , 0
    * Downloaded the input system

### 11/30/2023
* Nothing much really happened aside from Trello Board updating to make it more presentable.

### 12/2/2023
* Made the input system.
    * This was accomplished by making the input folder in the asset folder followed by creating the "Input Actions" and naming it PlayerInput.
    * By using the actionmap, I was able to make movement for both keyboard and controller by using the 2D Vector Composite
        * NOTE: There wasn't a "Add 2D Vector Composite option" in the Actions tab. The workaround for this was to set the Action type to "Value" then the Control Type to "Vector 2". Then you will see the option but renamed to "Add Up/Down/Left/Right Composite" .
    * Added the C# File named PlayerInput in the input folder.
    * Made some flooring and some blocks for the player to jump at.
