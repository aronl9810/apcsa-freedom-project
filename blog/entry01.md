Lets do this...two 11/11/2023

We are back! Back with a new chapter and a freedom project to create!

After the previous freedom project which was a major success, I plan to set the stakes higher for the next freedom project. Something unique from the rest of the freedom project, Something that people will enjoy.

Thats what I will set out to do. Since we are in APCSA, we get to create anything with any tool we wish. SEP11 was limited to javascript (but I chose to do an APCSA level project with permission from Mueller), but APCSA let us go wild. Its like you got access to a 5 star restaurants kitchen. You get to make whatever food you like.

Ok ok! Enough how ACPSA gave you the ultimate pass of freedom, what are you planning to do?

This year, I want to focus on creating a First Person Shooter game. I grew up with many First Person Shooters in my life such as Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Counter Strike, and Payday 2. There were other shooter games such as Splatoon 2 & 3 which is a third person chaotic paint game, but the feel of first person shooter games always brought be back playing them.
