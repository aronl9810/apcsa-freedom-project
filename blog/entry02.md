# Entry 2
The journey begins (Featuring Xin Yan) 12/12/2023

As always with Entry 2, we begin tinkering with our tool. Before we started tinkering though, we decided to do our own seperate mini project to get the hand with Unity before working on the main project. This way, we have a clear grasp of how Unity operates and no one is left confused or how x thing works.

The tutorial we used was created by [Natty GameDev](https://www.youtube.com/@NattyGameDev) and he made a [series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJqP5EesxLk&list=PLGUw8UNswJEOv8c5ZcoHarbON6mIEUFBC) where he teaches Unity beginners on how to make a simple first person shooter game. This tutorial was not that lengthy and provided enough information to us so we decided to take on it.

As I established before, me and Xin Yan are doing our own seperate mini project to get the hang with Unity. Our plan is to use the tutorial mentioned and create a simple little game to ourselves. Now you might be thinking this is a huge time waster as me and Xin Yan are basically making the freedom project seperately but this is not the case! In fact, it allows even more time efficient! By making 2 seperate mini projects, we can just copy and paste whatever we have on our mini project and adding more details there and there.

Now we did have a stict deadline for this and it is to complete all the tutorials before winter break because we want to work on the main project over the break. The first few months was mostly there for testing and trying out Unity. Our next couple of months is working on the main project itself and hopefully pushing it to a full game release.

At this point, lets highlight my experience during with my tinkering days. You can see [Xin Yan's](https://github.com/xinyanh4701/apcsa-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry02.md) journey here.

Before jumping into the tutorial, I need to learn the C# programming language. I found a tutorial where I can learn [C# in 10 minutes of less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFayQioG71A). This tutorial although fast, will teach you the basics of C#. What I found surprising is that C# is basically similar to Java with some slight wording differences. This is good as I keep learning Java, I can translate that to C#.

For example, take this function method.

In java...

```java
public static void functionname(parameters){
 // Code here
}
```

in C#...

```cs
static void functionname(parameters){
 // Code here
}
```

Pratically similar!
